      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the codebase analysis and development environment setup task into 5 specific subtasks, including repository setup, Deno installation, TypeScript configuration, architecture documentation, and coding standards establishment. For each subtask, provide specific deliverables and acceptance criteria.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple technical components (Deno, TypeScript, React) and requires both technical setup and documentation creation. The complexity comes from needing to understand the existing architecture while establishing new standards."

      "taskTitle": "Design Race Status Page Layout",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Race Status Page layout design into 4 subtasks covering responsive layout creation, typography and visibility optimization, section design (current race and 'Up Next'), and accessibility compliance. For each subtask, include design deliverables and review criteria.",
      "reasoning": "This design task requires balancing aesthetic considerations with functional requirements like visibility from a distance. The responsive design requirements and accessibility considerations add complexity."
    },

      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Current Race Information Display",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the current race information display implementation into 5 subtasks covering race identifier component, heat status display, pilot roster component, real-time lap counter, and channel assignment visualization. For each subtask, specify the data requirements and update behavior.",
      "reasoning": "This implementation requires creating multiple sub-components that must update in real-time. The real-time update requirement and visibility considerations make this moderately complex."

      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Implement 'Up Next' Information Section",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the 'Up Next' section implementation into 4 subtasks covering next heat details component, pilot roster display, channel assignment visualization, and estimated time calculation. For each subtask, define the data sources and update triggers.",
      "reasoning": "Similar to task 8 but slightly less complex as it doesn't require the same level of real-time updates. Still requires careful component design and clear visual distinction from current race information."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 10,
