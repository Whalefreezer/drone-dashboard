// Legacy types have been migrated to PocketBase-based types in src/api/pbTypes.ts
// Shared enums and types are now in src/common/enums.ts
// This file is kept for backward compatibility but exports nothing.

// If you need types, import from:
// - src/api/pbTypes.ts for PocketBase record types
// - src/common/enums.ts for shared enums and type aliases
