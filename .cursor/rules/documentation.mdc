 # Documentation Reference Guide

This rule ensures that relevant documentation is consulted when implementing tasks and is kept up-to-date as new documentation is added.

## Current Documentation

### Testing
- [deno-testing-guide.md](mdc:docs/deno-testing-guide.md)
  - Guide for testing practices in the Deno environment
  - Contains testing patterns, best practices, and examples

### Architecture & Planning
- [component-refactoring-plan.md](mdc:docs/component-refactoring-plan.md)
  - Details the plan for refactoring components
  - Includes architectural decisions and implementation strategies

## Usage Guidelines

- **Before Implementation:**
  - Review relevant documentation based on task type
  - Cross-reference architectural decisions
  - Follow established patterns and guidelines

- **During Implementation:**
  - Adhere to documented standards
  - Update documentation if implementation deviates from plans
  - Add inline references to relevant docs where appropriate

- **After Implementation:**
  - Update documentation to reflect any changes
  - Add new documentation for significant features
  - Cross-reference new docs in related files

## Documentation Updates

When documentation is added or updated:
1. Add an entry in the "Current Documentation" section
2. Categorize appropriately
3. Provide a brief summary of contents
4. Update any related cross-references

## Best Practices

- Keep summaries concise and focused
- Use relative links with `mdc:` prefix
- Maintain categorization for easy reference
- Update rule when docs are added/modified
- Include key information for quick reference
